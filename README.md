# Intro
The Devilish Elvish mess of an attempt at solving the Advent of Code 2021 problems. Unfortunately I only got going with this on day 15, so I'm basically batting around data before starting with my workday and after finishing the day's work. Every day the work is done in one file with the input file. The solutions usually only contain the second of the two puzzles as the first solution is hacked to become the second one.

# Language of choide
I started the first few puzzles with Bash as I could do them in the command
line or whip something up quickly. It soon became clear that another weapon of
choice was required. The first idea to do each day with a different language
starting with for instance asm for day 1, bash (or basic) day two, C (or C++ or
Cobol) day 3, D, Dart day 4, Erlang (or Excel) day5 etc. This did seem a little
tedious, especially since I started 15 days late. So, looking at the puzzles, I
decided to go for Python (and subsequently gave the first python file the perl
extension :). It just seemed like an easier choice for the type of input and
data massaging that is required for the problems.


#Disclaimer
This is not how I usually write and maintain code. This is basically throwing
as much as possible in all directions and then picking the bits that stayed
stuck. Any attempt to keep my myself clean went out the open window (against
which nothing stuck, duh!). If nothing else, it is proof that I enjoy these
puzzles too much to copy code from someone else :)

The only chance of getting things done is by threatening my elves with the
pruning shears. They know by now that they better get cracking or the toes go a
flying. "On the first day of Christmas my overlord took from me, one pinky
toe.", they seemingly sang joyfully at the end of the first day. Nothing gets
things done like the pruning shears in the velvet glove. Don't tell them, but
fingers are off limits. Without, they can't type....
